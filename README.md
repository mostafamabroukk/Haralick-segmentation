Brain Tumour Segmentation in MRI Images using Haralick Textural Features

This thesis discusses the problem of brain tumours and how to segment them from various MRI images. Using the textural features of the images helps the segmentation process to detect the tumour or the lesion accurately. Generally, there are fourteen different textural features named as Haralick features extracted from an image. To make the process more precise and to produce a higher F-measure, the most useful features are selected, averaged, and used as input for the segmentation algorithm.

Features: Sum of variance and Sum of average are used.

Segmentation process: Multiphase Chan Vese algorithm is used.

The class is written in C.
